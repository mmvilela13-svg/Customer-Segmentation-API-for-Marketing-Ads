# Customer-Segmentation-API-for-Marketing-Ads
This bonus workflow builds on top of the Supabase database populated by the previous workflows.  It exposes a REST API (GET endpoint) that feeds a web application and analyzes stored customer data and documentation to create audience segments for marketing campaigns, specifically for paid ads.

While the workflow may appear simple, it is highly effective and productive, enabling data-driven marketing decisions with minimal operational overhead.
